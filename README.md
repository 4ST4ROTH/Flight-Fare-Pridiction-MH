#BUILD DOCKER IMAGE
docker build -t <image_name>:<tag_name> .
-image_name should be in lower case and tag_name generally use 'latest'

docker images To list Docker Image and get IMAGE_ID
Run Docker Image docker run -p 5000:5000 -e PORT=5000 <IMAGE_ID>
docker ps To check running container in docker
docker stop <container_id> to stop docker container

#Notes
If adding '-e .' then we must have setup.py file in root directory. This will create <custom_pkg_name>-egg.info file for every package which contains "init.py" file. Where "-e ." executed inside "requirements.txt". Its actually lunching the "setup.py" hence the egg.info file will get created for all custom packages.
